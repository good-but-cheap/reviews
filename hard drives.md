Check your computer to see what kind of hard drive it will accept. 

M.2 NVMe is the latest common form factor, it looks like a circuit board, they've been common in laptops for a few years, and are supported by recent desktops as well. 

SATA is a slightly older interface, with box-shaped drives. There's a 3.5" form factor for desktops, and a 2.5" for laptops or desktops. Solid State Drives (SSDs) and spinning magnetic Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) both exist in this form factor. HHDs are a way to get more storage for less money, SSDs will give you better speed when launching programs or accessing files.
