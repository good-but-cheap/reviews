- Ports
{% endcapture %}

{% capture know %}
- How much Power, measured in Watts, does your laptop need?
    - 65 Watts is typical
    - A small Macbook air is 30 Watts, a gaming laptop with a dedicated GPU can be 100 Watts or more
    - Usually, a small laptop can use a large power supply and it will only consume what it needs. A large laptop will charge slowly from a small power supply and under heavy loads the battery may still run down
- What accessories will you be connecting?
    - HDMI or DP monitor
    - USB A devices
    - USB C devices
    - Ethernet
    - SD cardss

{% capture recommendation %}
- Lasuney 12 in 1 USB C Dock
    - https://www.lasuney.net/products/11
    - https://www.amazon.com/Lasuney-Display-Ethernet-Adapter-Compatible/dp/B086QXDXXZ
    - 87W, HDMI + DP, ethernet, 4 USB ports and SD card slot on front face
- Selore
    - https://www.amazon.com/Docking-Station-Monitor-Display-Ethernet/dp/B08SJTGYJK
    - One fewer USB port than the Lasuney, better arrangement for left-hand USB ports

{% capture more %}
- There are a variety of rebranded versions of these devices. Find one with the port layout you like, they all seem to perform about the same, assuming they have reasonably good reviews.
- There is a step up from here in laptop docks, but it's 3-4x as expensive. At this price point, look for an option from your laptop manufacturer, or something like the [Anker 575 USB-C Docking Station](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Docking-PowerExpand-Charging-Ethernet/dp/B088F7SY6S).
