## What you need to know:

First, you should know that 

### Power

How much power does a laptop need?
- 65 Watts is typical
- 30 Watts for a small MacBook Air
- 100 Watts or more for a gaming laptop with a dedicated GPU
- Usually, small laptops can use larger power supplies without issue, and a large laptop will charge slowly from a small power supply though sometimes not fast enough to keep the battery from draining

Hubs aren't completely efficient, so the power output to the laptop will be less than the input power.


### Connectivity

There are many hubs available, with a variety of port arrangements. You can usually choose from some of the following:
- Displays
  - HDMI
  - Display Port
  - VGA
- USB
  - Type A
  - Type C
- Audio
- Networking
- SD Card Slots

### Quality

There are not *great* options for USB Docks.

    - One fewer USB port than the Lasuney, better arrangement for left-hand USB ports
{% endcapture %}

{% capture more %}
- There are a variety of rebranded versions of these devices. Find one with the port layout you like, they all seem to perform about the same, assuming they have reasonably good reviews.
- There is a step up from here in laptop docks, but it's 3-4x as expensive. At this price point, look for an option from your laptop manufacturer, or something like the [Anker 575 USB-C Docking Station](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Docking-PowerExpand-Charging-Ethernet/dp/B088F7SY6S).
