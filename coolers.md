## Considerations:

- Size
- Insulation
- Convenience Features (handles, wheels, bottle openers, etc.)

## What you need to know:

### Size
Cooler sizes are measured *inconsistently*, you see the size measured in liters, gallons, quarts, or cans. As a rough guide:
- 50 liters ~= 54 quarts ~= 13 gal ~= 77 cans
- This is a "medium size" cooler, estimate up or down from here with whatever units are being advertised

### Insulation
Insulation is measured in days of ice retention, at least by some manufacturers. There are some facts you should know about this measurement:
- A big cooler will always keep ice longer than a small cooler. Imagine a big pile of ice and a small pile of ice sitting in the sun, the small ice pile will melt sooner. The same applies to coolers with similar insulation, a big one will keep ice longer than a small one.
- The numbers assume you drain water regularly
- They also assume you start with a pre-cooled cooler. If you want to get close to the times that are advertised, put some ice in the cooler 12+ hours ahead of your trip to give the insulation itself a chance to cool down. The same applies to food you put in the freezer, if you put it in warm, it will melt more ice than necessary while it comes down to temperature.
- The numbers will vary based on the ambient temperature.

### Convenience Features
Lots of extra features are available. The decision comes down to personal preference, here is a list of the more common options:
- Handles
- Wheels
- Lock
- Bottle Opener
- Hinged Lid
- Cup Holders
- Seat
- "Bear Proof" rating
- Material: Metal, Plastic, Roto-molded plastic, soft-sided
